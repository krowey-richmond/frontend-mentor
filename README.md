# Frontend Mentor Portfolio

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1ec1204d-87d3-4384-94bd-78eee6630e87/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/frontendmentor-dev/deploys)

This repository serves as a **central hub** for my Frontend Mentor challenge solutions. Each challenge lives in its own folder and is accessible through a clean, minimal HTML homepage that acts as a navigation directory across all projects.

The focus of this repository is **frontend fundamentals, structure, and production-level organization** — showing how isolated component challenges translate into a cohesive workflow.

## 🧭 How This Repository Works

- The root contains an `index.html` file.
- This page functions as a **mini portfolio / project directory**.
- Each listed item links directly to a Frontend Mentor challenge inside this repository.
- Every project is self-contained and can run independently.

This reflects real-world frontend architecture:

> One entry point → Multiple modular implementations.

- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, responsiveness)

JavaScript will be introduced progressively for interactive challenges.

## ♿ Accessibility

Attention is given to:

- Semantic HTML usage
- Logical heading structure
- Keyboard-friendly navigation (where applicable)
- Responsive behavior across devices

Accessibility is treated as a requirement — not an optional enhancement.

- New challenges are added incrementally
- The homepage evolves as the portfolio grows

The goal is consistent improvement, not rushed completion.
